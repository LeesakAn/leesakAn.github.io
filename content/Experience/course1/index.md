## About Gender Politics Research Group

The Gender Politics Research Group is a scholarly community that examines the deepening gender conflicts in Korean society from a political science perspective and seeks institutional and policy-based solutions.

In recent years, gender issues have expanded beyond the social realm to become prominent political questions. Yet systematic political science research and concrete policy responses remain limited.

Grounded in this concern, the Gender Politics Research Group aims to analyze how gender conflict shapes political processes and to explore institutional approaches that can help address these challenges.
