## Description

As the Head Research Assistant for the Gender Politics Research Group, I support both the academic and administrative operations of the team. My work spans project coordination, data management, survey design, and collaboration with faculty and external researchers.

#### Key Responsibilities and Projects

+ Lead liaison work with professors and external collaborators, including organizing invited talks, requesting research materials, and managing communication channels.
+ Supervise and train student research assistants, especially those involved in human-coding tasks for the gender-sensitivity dataset. I designed and led coding-guideline workshops to maintain consistency and reliability. [(Seminar Syllabus)](Syllabus.pdf)
+ Oversee budgeting and administrative tasks for the research group.

#### Gender-Sensitivity Text Data Project
+ Crawled and processed National Assembly meeting transcripts to build a large-scale dataset of legislators’ statements.
+ Contributed to the development of a machine-learning dictionary that identifies varying levels of gender sensitivity in political speech.
+ Worked with linguistics researchers to extend this framework to other corpora, including public hearing transcripts, party platforms, and various political texts.

#### Survey Research and Independent Work
+ Co-designed and administered surveys on gender perceptions, gender discrimination, and political attitudes.
+ Conducted an independent research project analyzing how experiences of gender discrimination shape political participation, using data produced through the group’s earlier work. [(Go to Working paper page)](https://leesakan.github.io/papers/paper3/)

## About Gender Politics Research Group

The Gender Politics Research Group is a scholarly community that examines the deepening gender conflicts in Korean society from a political science perspective and seeks institutional and policy-based solutions.

In recent years, gender issues have expanded beyond the social realm to become prominent political questions. Yet systematic political science research and concrete policy responses remain limited.

Grounded in this concern, the Gender Politics Research Group aims to analyze how gender conflict shapes political processes and to explore institutional approaches that can help address these challenges.
