## About Peace & Democracy Institute

The Peace & Democracy Institute (PDI) was established to strengthen research capacity in the humanities and social sciences by advancing social-scientific theories and supporting academic activities aimed at creating a political order grounded in peace, prosperity, and justice on the Korean Peninsula and in its surrounding regions.

Originally founded in 1988 as the “Peace Research Institute,” the center focused on peacebuilding on the Korean Peninsula and international relations in Asia. In March 2010, it was renamed the Peace & Democracy Institute to reflect an expanded research agenda and to promote specialization through the establishment of multiple affiliated centers. PDI currently operates the following thematic research centers: the EU Studies Center, the International Security Center, the East Asia Center for Reconciliation and Cooperation, the Conflict Studies Center, the Political Leadership Center, and the Korea–Asia Development Cooperation Center.

PDI is an affiliated research institute of Korea University and operates within the Department of Political Science and International Relations. All full-time faculty members of the department participate as council members, and research professors and fellows trained in political science at leading universities in Korea and abroad engage in active research under the institute’s umbrella.

One of the core social roles of a university research institute is to make academic knowledge accessible to the public. Through its website, PDI disseminates a wide range of research outputs and seeks to enhance public understanding of politics, peace, and democracy through structured civic education programs.
