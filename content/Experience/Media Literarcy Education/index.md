## Description

As a mentor in a media literacy program supported by the Korea Press Foundation, I worked with high school students as they investigated everyday political issues and transformed their findings into news articles. I guided students through topic selection, interviews, background research, and article writing, helping them understand how information is gathered, interpreted, and communicated in the media.

## Project Overview

+ High school education program focused on improving media literacy through hands-on reporting.
+ Students identified political issues in their daily lives, conducted interviews, and produced article-style writing.
+ Emphasized critical reading, source evaluation, and understanding the production process behind news content.
