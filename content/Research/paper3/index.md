##### Abstract

This study investigates how experiences of gender discrimination influence political participation and how these effects vary by gender, age, and perceptions of gender inequality. Using a 2024 nationwide online survey, we examine multiple forms of participation, including petition signing, protest involvement, and online commenting. Our findings show that individuals who have encountered gender discrimination report higher levels of political engagement. Moderation analyses indicate that the effect is stronger among men and younger respondents. Subgroup models further reveal that men in their twenties and thirties display the largest increase in participation following discriminatory experiences compared to women of the same age and older men and women. This pattern is linked to perceptions of gendered disadvantage across the life course, which play a central role in shaping reactions to discrimination.
Additional analyses demonstrate that perceived gender inequality conditions the relationship between discrimination and specific participation modes. Among men, stronger perceptions of disadvantage heighten the effect on online commenting, while among women, a similar pattern appears for petition and appeal signing. These findings reflect broader trends in South Korea, where online spaces have become important channels for young men’s claims of reverse discrimination, while petition-based activism has grown among women in the post–MeToo context. Overall, the study highlights heterogeneous pathways through which discrimination experiences translate into political participation.
