##### Abstract

This book grew out of an undergraduate civic politics course at Korea University, where I guided students through a semester-long project on local ordinance making. The class focused on identifying problems in everyday life, meeting stakeholders, and translating real concerns into policy proposals that local governments could adopt. Students conducted field interviews across Seoul and examined issues such as post-care support for youth leaving shelters, assistance for young adults preparing for independence, housing challenges facing college students, accessibility for people with visual impairments, senior meal programs, and public safety at large events.
Based on these interviews and community visits, students developed draft ordinances organized into four themes: treating youth as autonomous actors rather than dependents, addressing community problems collectively, promoting social well-being, and preventing recurring tragedies. The book presents these drafts along with reflections on the research and consultation process. It offers a view of how university students can engage with their communities and translate lived experiences into practical policy ideas. Through this project, the class aimed to propose modest but meaningful steps toward a more inclusive and supportive society.
