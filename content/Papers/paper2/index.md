##### Abstract

Political science research on Chinese nationalism has usually relied on a division between the ruling party and the public, which limits our understanding of how state narratives interact with social change. We argue that nationalism in the Xi era cannot be explained within this fixed divide. Under Xi, the government has promoted a renewed cultural identity that highlights heritage, aesthetics, and civilizational pride. This project meets a generation shaped by digital culture, fragmented communities, flexible identity practices, and low engagement with formal politics. Their responses have produced outcomes the state did not fully anticipate. We describe this pattern as individualized nationalism, built on four features: strong cultural pride, pragmatic calculations, selective exclusion of foreign actors perceived as violating cultural or territorial boundaries, and the rise of post-political forms of participation. This approach shows that nationalism today results from the meeting point between top-level identity reconstruction and bottom-up personal expression. It moves beyond the party–mass dichotomy and offers a clearer account of how current public attitudes influence domestic politics and external behavior.
