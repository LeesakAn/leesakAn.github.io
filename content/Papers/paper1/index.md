##### Abstract

Given the intensity of the public debate surrounding feminism, a critical question arises: what is it, exactly, about “feminism” that so many people find objectionable? Recent studies increasingly highlight that while backlash against feminism has intensified, there is growing consensus among younger generations in support of gender equality. But few studies have empirically examined how the label 'feminism' affects political attitudes and behavior when attached to political issues. This study addresses this gap by testing whether the term feminism, when used to describe a contentious political issue, alters public responses. A vignette-based experimental survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,000 Korean adults in 2025. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: in the treatment group, the 2024 presidential impeachment was described as led by a feminist coalition; in the control group, by a general civic coalition. The study assessed two outcome variables: support for impeachment (political attitude) and willingness to participate in protests (political behavior). The results demonstrate that the labeling effect is conditional rather than uniform. While the average treatment effect on issue support was not statistically significant, substantial variation emerged across ideological dimensions. Notably, feminism labeling markedly increased behavioral intention regardless of respondents’ position on the impeachment, challenging the prevailing assumption that such labeling necessarily induces political disengagement or avoidance. These findings highlight that even when policy content remains constant, a single word can reshape political meaning and mobilize different segments of the public. By focusing on labeling as a form of framing, the study underscores the need to consider how symbolic language interacts with existing belief systems and potentially exacerbates political polarization in identity-based contexts, especially in South Korea.
