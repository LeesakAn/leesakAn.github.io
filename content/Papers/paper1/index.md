##### Abstract

Despite intense public debate over feminism in South Korea, recent empirical research indicates growing consensus on gender equality among younger generations, raising questions about whether opposition targets feminism's substantive principles or the label itself. This study examines whether labeling a politically salient issue as "feminism" influences public attitudes and behavioral intentions. A vignette-based survey experiment was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,000 Korean adults in 2025. Respondents were randomly assigned to conditions where the 2024 presidential impeachment was described as led by either a feminist coalition or a general civic coalition. Two outcomes were assessed: impeachment support and protest participation willingness. Results show no significant average treatment effect on impeachment attitudes, but substantial variation emerged across ideological and gender lines. Progressive respondents and women showed increased support while conservative respondents and men showed decreased support. Feminist labeling significantly increased behavioral intentions uniformly across all groups regardless of substantive positions on impeachment. These findings demonstrate that "feminism" functions as a polarizing cognitive cue in attitude formation while simultaneously operating as a mobilizing signal for political action. The label conditionally shapes political judgments through interaction with prior predispositions yet independently mobilizes behavioral engagement. The study contributes to understanding how ideologically charged labels operate in contemporary political discourse and challenges assumptions that such labeling uniformly induces disengagement or backlash.
