##### Abstract

This study examines whether local Pride parades shape attitudes toward sexual minorities among nearby residents in South Korea. While public debate often focuses on conflict between activist groups and conservative organizations, little is known about how these events influence the broader community that observes them in everyday settings. I compile an original dataset covering all Pride parades held between 2013 and 2024 and link it with survey data, regional demographics, and political context. This allows me to test whether exposure to a parade, either through direct contact in the neighborhood or indirect exposure through local media, is associated with shifts in support for LGBTQ rights and changes in political engagement. Using comparisons across parade and non-parade regions, I analyze how local culture, age composition, and religious presence condition these effects. Preliminary findings suggest that parade exposure corresponds to modest improvements in acceptance and higher willingness to engage with related political issues. These results highlight the everyday influence of public events and provide evidence that community-level contact, even without personal interaction, can play a role in reducing prejudice. The study contributes new evidence from a non-Western context using a decade of spatial and temporal data.
